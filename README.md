## BACKGROUND
Supply chain management plays a critical role in today's business environment, enabling
companies to effectively plan, source, produce, and deliver goods and services to customers. With
increasing market dynamics and customer expectations, organizations are constantly seeking ways
to optimize their supply chain operations. One of the key factors in achieving this optimization is
accurate demand forecasting and efficient inventory management.

Accurate demand forecasting allows organizations to align their production and procurement
activities with the anticipated customer demand, reducing stockouts, minimizing excess inventory,
and ensuring timely fulfillment of orders. It helps in streamlining the supply chain, optimizing
resource allocation, and improving overall operational efficiency. On the other hand, inventory
management aims to strike a balance between meeting customer demands and minimizing
inventory holding costs. By monitoring inventory levels, turnover rates, and lead times,
organizations can avoid stockouts, reduce carrying costs, and optimize their working capital.

To achieve effective demand forecasting and inventory management, organizations are
increasingly turning to advanced analytics techniques. By leveraging historical sales data,
organizations can analyze patterns, trends, and seasonality to make accurate predictions about
future demand. This allows them to plan production, adjust inventory levels, and optimize the
supply chain network.

The dataset provided for this project, the "Superstore Sales" dataset by Rohit Sahoo, is a valuable
resource for conducting supply chain analytics. It contains historical sales data for a retail
company, encompassing various product categories, store locations, and sales volumes over time.
This dataset serves as a rich source of information to develop demand forecasting models and
perform inventory analysis, for more details refer to the Data Source section.

By utilizing this dataset, we aim to apply analytics techniques to generate insights and forecasts
that will empower organizations to make informed supply chain decisions. The project will focus
on analyzing the dataset to develop accurate demand forecasts, understand inventory dynamics,
and identify opportunities for improvement within the supply chain. Additionally, descriptive
analytics will provide a comprehensive understanding of the dataset, enabling us to explore its
structure, uncover patterns, and gain insights into customer behavior.

Through this project we aim to leverage the "Superstore Sales" dataset to perform demand
forecasting, and descriptive analytics on its categories. The results obtained from this analysis will
guide organizations in making strategic and tactical decisions to optimize their supply chain
operations, reduce costs, and maximize profitability.

## OBJECTIVES

### 2. Data Preprocessing

Data preprocessing is a crucial step in any data analysis project. In this step, the data is cleaned,
transformed, and organized to ensure its quality and suitability for further analysis. The following
tasks have been performed as part of the data preprocessing step:

i. Removing Unwanted Columns:

Unwanted columns that are not relevant to the analysis have been removed based on the
project objectives and analytics methods identified. For example, columns like "Order ID"
or "Customer Name" may not provide significant insights for the specific analysis tasks
such as demand forecasting, inventory analysis, or network consolidation.

ii. Handling Missing Values


A check was performed for missing values in the dataset. If any columns contain missing
values.

iii. Organizing the dataset

To facilitate time-series analysis, the "Order Date" column was set as the index of the
dataset. This indexing enables easy access and analysis of time-series data, which is often
important for tasks such as forecasting or trend analysis.

### 3. Exploratory Data Analysis

The dataset is large and includes various characteristics that can be used to analyze different
attributes such as categories, subcategories, regions, countries, and customer segments. However,
we have identified that dividing the dataset based on product categories would be beneficial. Thus,


the dataset was split based on three categories: office supplies, furniture, and technology. This
categorization allows for easier analysis and comparison within specific product categories while
integrating the sales data from the same date together. By looking at the Figure 1 below we can
see the average monthly sales for the three categories in detail.

## ANALYTICS METHOD

Time series forecasting is a well-known problem in data science and statistics. We will analyze
and forecast the time series data of the superstore dataset specifically for demand forecasting. In
our case, we consider the Sales values as the demand observed over different time periods. The
Figure 6 below illustrates the Flow Diagram for Time Series Forecasting in this project.

While it is possible to perform time series analysis in Excel, we will explore various methods using
Python for our analysis and forecasting purposes.

### Demand Forecasting

Demand forecasting helps organizations by providing managers valuable insights for their
businesses, allowing them to make informed decisions regarding pricing, growth plans, and market
potential. Demand forecasting is crucial for sales planning because it helps businesses foresee and
get prepared for future demand for their goods and services. By accurately forecasting demand,
businesses may more effectively plan their production schedules and manage inventory levels,
which will save storage costs and optimize the use of resources.

Accurate demand forecasting is also essential for financial planning and budgeting since it enables
companies to estimate their prospective income and profit, which enables them to make wise
decisions about their pricing strategies and expenditure plans. Demand forecasting can also offer
useful insights for the sales and marketing teams, as it can assist those in charge in establishing


realistic sales goals, creating a successful marketing campaign, and identifying market segments
with the most potential for growth.

From Superstore dataset, demand forecasting can be done by analyzing historical data to forecast
future sales patterns while assessing whether seasonality and trends are present. By examining the
order date and sales data, the seasonality of a sales demand can be determined, which is helpful in
optimizing production, inventory and marketing strategies accordingly. Furthermore, the dataset
also allows users to recognize the long-term trends in the demand, allowing them to forecast the
future demand levels and make strategic decisions. Lastly, segmenting the dataset based on factors
such as product categories enables users to gain insight into different demand patterns. It assists in
tailoring the forecasting and planning strategies into product categories, allowing a more accurate
prediction and targeted decision making.

### Static Method

In this section, our main objective is to analyze and forecast the average monthly sales for three
distinct business categories: Office Supplies, Furniture, and Technologies. Each category
represents a significant segment of our business, and understanding their sales patterns is crucial
for strategic decision-making. By employing a static method approach, we will delve into historical
sales data, identify trends, and make informed predictions for each category individually. Through
this analysis, we aim to gain insights into the performance of each category and provide valuable
information for future business planning.

Methodology:

1. Data Collection and Preprocessing:
    - We have gathered comprehensive sales data for each category, ensuring a
       substantial time span to capture relevant patterns and trends.
    - The collected data has been preprocessed, including cleaning, handling missing
       values, and organizing it in chronological order.
    - Essential columns, such as order dates and sales figures, have been extracted for
       further analysis.
2. Office Supplies Category Analysis:
    - Given that the Office Supplies category leads in terms of sales, we will begin our
       analysis by focusing on this category.
    - We will examine the historical sales trends, seasonal patterns, and overall
       performance of the Office Supplies category.
4. Furniture Category Analysis:
    - Moving on to the Furniture category, we will conduct a detailed analysis of its sales data.
    - We will explore its sales patterns, identify any potential seasonality or trends, and
    - gain insights into its performance within the market.

4. Technologies Category Analysis:
    - Similarly, we will analyze the sales data for the Technologies category.
    - By studying the historical sales trends and patterns specific to this category, we will
       uncover valuable information about its performance and market dynamics.
5. Average Quarterly Sales Calculation:
    - For each category, we will calculate the average Monthly sales to gain a high-level
       understanding of their performance over time.
    - By resampling the data on a quarterly basis, we can identify the average sales for
       each quarter and assess any seasonal or long-term trends.
6. Visualization and Insights:
    - Throughout the analysis, we will create visualizations to showcase the sales trends
       and patterns for each category.
    - These visual representations will provide valuable insights into historical
       performance, seasonal fluctuations, and potential growth opportunities.
7. Forecasting:
    - Using the static method approach, we will employ suitable forecasting techniques
       for each category individually.
    - Time series analysis, regression models, or other appropriate methods will be
       utilized to forecast the future average quarterly sales for each category.
8. Evaluation and Comparison:
    - To evaluate the accuracy and reliability of our forecasting models, we will compare
       the forecasted results with the actual sales data for each category.
    - Evaluation metrics specific to forecasting, such as mean squared error or mean
       absolute percentage error, will be used to assess the performance of the static
       method approach.

Through this project, we aim to analyze and forecast the average monthly sales for three significant
business categories: Office Supplies, Furniture, and Technologies. By delving into historical sales
data, identifying trends, and making predictions using the static method approach, we can gain
valuable insights into the performance of each category.

These insights will aid in strategic decision-making, market analysis, and resource allocation
within our business. By understanding the unique sales patterns and dynamics of each category,
we can optimize our operations, identify growth opportunities, and enhance overall business
performance.

### Adaptive Method

Adaptive forecasting model is a time series forecasting method that iteratively updates and
optimizes forecasts using historical data until new data becomes available. The model is being
utilized in demand planning as the model understands that demand patterns can change over time,
necessitating an iterative forecasting model to capture the changes.

In the adaptive forecasting model, the initial forecast is generated using historical data and the
selected forecasting model, such as moving average, simple exponential smoothing, Holt’s Model
or Winter’s model. The model is being continuously adjusted to integrate the most recent data as
new data points are observed.

Adaptive forecasting models have advantages against static methods in a way the model is iterative
and the ability to capture trends and seasonalities in the data. Adaptive forecasting models enable
businesses to capture the demand pattern, in this case, the sales pattern whether there is trend and
seasonality occurs, allowing for flexibility and responsiveness in demand planning. The model can
offer a more accurate forecast for efficient demand planning and be beneficial for relevant
departments in aligning their goals and strategies for the business. In this report, the adaptive
forecasting model methodology are as follows:

1. Data Preprocessing
   - The monthly and quarterly average sales dataset extracted is being split into training
     and testing datasets.
   - For quarterly average sales, quartly_sales.shape indicates that the size of the dataset
     is 16. Hence, a dataset with the size of 12 is being split into a training set and a
     dataset with the size of 4 is being split into the testing set. This indicated that the
     forecasting will be for 4 quarterly periods which also can indicate one year forecasting.
   - For monthly average sales, monthly_sales.shape indicates that the size of the
     dataset is 48, so the dataset is being split into 42 months for the training set and 6
     months for testing set, which indicates the forecasting.

2. Forecasting & analysis using various adaptive forecasting model methods
   - The split datasets are now being used to forecast using the Simple Moving Average
     method for monthly forecasting and a graph is plotted to observe the pattern with
     the training set, the testing set and the simple moving average forecast.
   - The forecasting error, RMSE and MAPE are being calculated and plotted into a dataframe.
   - The same step is being repeated for quarterly sales average forecasting.
   - The three steps aforementioned are now being repeated with Simple Exponential
     Smoothing method, Holt’s Model, which only accounts for the trend and Winter’s
     Model with Multiplication, which accounts for the trend and seasonality in the dataset.

3. Forecasting product average monthly sales
   - From the forecasting error, the best method for forecasting is being selected to
     forecast the product monthly sales average according to its categories.
   - The first product category, y_furniture datasets, is being split into training and
     testing sets where 42 datasets are for training sets and 6 datasets are for testing sets.
   - Then, we can forecast using Winter’s Model with Multiplication method and a
     graph is plotted to observe the pattern in the product sales.
   - The forecasting error, RMSE and MAPE can be calculated and plotted into a dataframe.
   - The same steps are being repeated for the remaining product categories and now
     we have the 6 months forecast for the products monthly sales average.

### Performance Metrics

Three matrices are used to measure the performance accuracy of the proposed models: 
- Mean Square Error (MSE) for weekly, monthly, or yearly forecast.

- Root Mean Square Error (RMSE) for the forecast.

- Mean Absolute Percentage Error (MAPE) for quantifying overall accuracy.

### RESULTS & DISCUSSION

#### Static Method

1. Office Supplies Category

The analysis for the Office Supplies category was performed using the static method approach
with OLS (Ordinary Least Squares) regression. The model obtained a score of
0.597025250632492, indicating a moderate level of fit between the predicted values and the actual
sales data. However, the R-squared value of 0.023 suggests that only a small portion (2.3%) of the
variance in the average Monthly sales can be explained by the model.

Upon examining the OLS regression results, the coefficient for the "Deseasonalized_data" variable
is 0.0081, with a p-value of 0.304. The coefficient signifies the change in the average quarterly
sales for every unit change in the deseasonalized data. However, the p-value suggests that this
coefficient is not statistically significant at the conventional significance level (α = 0.05). Hence,
the model's ability to accurately predict the average monthly sales based on the deseasonalized
data is limited.

The evaluation of the model's performance includes the analysis of the final table shown in Figure
7 below, which provides the seasonal factor (SF) for each period. The SF represents the ratio of
the observed sales data to the deseasonalized data, indicating the seasonal variation present in the
Office Supplies category. The SF values range from 0.150231 to 2.176449, suggesting varying
degrees of seasonal impact across different periods.

<div align="center">
  <img src="https://github.com/ahvshim/Supply_Chain_Analytic/assets/126220185/f867cd89-abb8-4dc2-a576-f4a969a009d9" alt="Ahmed-SCA Project pdf Page 6 image 1">
  <p><b>Figure 7: Office supply seasonal factor table</b></p>
</div>

When interpreting the SF values, periods with SFs less than 1 indicate lower sales than the
deseasonalized average, whereas SFs greater than 1 indicate higher sales. In the Office Supplies

category, periods 2, 10, 12, 18, 30, 37, 38, 39, 40, and 42 have SFs less than 1, indicating lower
sales compared to the average. On the other hand, periods 9, 11, 16, 17, 20, 21, 26, 32, 33, 34, 35,
36, 43, 44, 45, 46, and 48 have SFs greater than 1, suggesting higher sales than the average.

Overall, the analysis of the Office Supplies category reveals that the static method approach with
OLS regression has limitations in accurately predicting the average quarterly sales. The R-squared
value indicates that the model does not capture a significant portion of the sales variation, and the
coefficient for the deseasonalized data is not statistically significant. Additionally, the varying SF
values highlight the presence of seasonal patterns, with some periods exhibiting lower or higher
sales compared to the deseasonalized average.

To improve the accuracy of forecasting for the Office Supplies category, alternative forecasting
techniques or models can be explored.

2. Furniture Category

The analysis for the Furniture category was performed using the static method approach with OLS
(Ordinary Least Squares) regression. However, the model obtained a low score of
0.0005782344925936433, indicating a weak fit between the predicted values and the actual sales
data. The R-squared value of 0.000 suggests that the model explains very little (0%) of the variance
in the dependent variable, which is the Period_t.

Upon examining the OLS regression results in Figure 8 Below, the coefficient for the
"Deseasonalized_data" variable is 4.313e-05, with a p-value of 0.994. The coefficient represents
the change in the dependent variable for every unit change in the deseasonalized data. However,
the p-value indicates that this coefficient is not statistically significant at the conventional
significance level (α = 0.05). This means that there is no significant relationship between the
deseasonalized data and the Period_t variable in the Furniture category.

<div align="center">
  <img src="https://github.com/ahvshim/Supply_Chain_Analytic/assets/126220185/d0981457-5de3-4756-bbe8-9b78a69d2563" alt="Ahmed-SCA Project pdf Page 6 image 1">
  <p><b>Figure 8: Furniture OLS regression results</b></p>
</div>

The evaluation of the model's performance includes the analysis of the final table, which provides
the values for Period_t, Sales, Deseasonalized_data, Dt, and SF for each period. The SF represents
the seasonal factor, indicating the influence of seasonal patterns on the sales data. The Dt variable
represents the deseasonalized data with trend, removing the seasonal component while considering
any underlying trend. Given the low R-squared value and the non-significant coefficient for the
deseasonalized data, it suggests that the model does not accurately capture the patterns or factors
driving the variation in the Period_t variable for the Furniture category. This implies that there
may be other factors or variables not considered in the analysis that are more relevant in explaining
the variations in sales.

3. Technology Category

The Technology category was analyzed using a static method approach called OLS regression
(Ordinary Least Squares). The model achieved a score of 0.5576094203666919, indicating a
moderate fit between the predicted values and actual sales data. However, the low R-squared value
of 0.009 suggests that only a small fraction (0.9%) of the variation in average monthly sales can
be explained by the model.

Examining the OLS regression results, the coefficient for the "Deseasonalized_data" variable is
0.0031, with a p-value of 0.525. This coefficient represents the impact on average quarterly sales


for each unit change in the deseasonalized data. However, the p-value indicates that the coefficient
is not statistically significant at the conventional significance level (α = 0.05). Consequently, the
model's ability to accurately predict average monthly sales based on the deseasonalized data is
limited. The model's performance was evaluated by analyzing the final table, which provides the
seasonal factor (SF) for each period. SF represents the ratio of observed sales data to
deseasonalized data, indicating the seasonal variation in the Technology category. SF values range
from 0.286958 to 2.671485, signifying different degrees of seasonal impact across periods.

Interpreting the SF values in the Figure 9 below, periods with SFs below 1 indicate lower sales
compared to the deseasonalized average, while SFs above 1 suggest higher sales. In the
Technology category, periods 1, 2, 6, 7, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 18, 21, 22, 27, 28, 30, 31, 32, 33, 37,
40, 41, 43, 44, 45, and 47 have SFs below 1, indicating lower sales. Conversely, periods 3, 4, 5, 8,
15, 16, 17, 19, 20, 23, 24, 25, 26, 29, 34, 35, 36, 38, 39, 42, 46, and 48 have SFs above 1, suggesting
higher sales.


<div align="center">
  <img src="https://github.com/ahvshim/Supply_Chain_Analytic/assets/126220185/5ffc6edc-e278-4b8f-963c-1f69a1e6e85a" alt="Ahmed-SCA Project pdf Page 6 image 1">
  <p><b>Figure 9: Technology seasonal factor table</b></p>
</div>

In conclusion, the analysis of the Technology category highlights limitations in accurately
predicting average monthly sales using the static method approach with OLS regression. The low
R-squared value indicates that the model fails to capture a significant portion of sales variation,
and the coefficient for deseasonalized data lacks statistical significance. Moreover, the varying SF
values indicate the presence of seasonal patterns, with certain periods experiencing lower or higher
sales compared to the deseasonalized average.

  <p><b>Figure 11: Graph of Simple Moving Average Model for Monthly Sales</b></p>
</div>

Figure 10 and Figure 11 shows the plot for adaptive forecasting using the simple moving average
model for monthly sales and quarterly sales. From the graph, it can be seen that the sales dataset
shows an upwards trend and seasonality occurs. The model takes the rolling window at a period
of 3 months of historical data to predict the future values. However, it can be seen that the model
can only predict the training sets and not account the testing sets. This makes sense since the
disadvantage of a simple moving average model is that the model does not account for future
events and only can be used for past datasets. The model also does not capture the trend and
seasonality occurred, hence, cannot be used for future sales forecasting methods.

  <p><b>Figure 13: Graph of Simple Exponential Model for Quarterly Sales</b></p>
</div>

The graph for simple exponential smoothing forecast for monthly and quarterly sales is being
plotted as shown in Figure 12 and Figure 13. It can be seen that the simple exponential smoothing
does not provide a good forecasting result as the forecasting values remain the same. According
to Hydman and Athanasopoulos, a simple exponential smoothing forecast can give the same value
as the model has a “flat” forecast function. This indicates that the forecast obtains the same value
equal to the last level component (Hydman and Athanasopoulos, 2018). This is because the model
works the best with time series data that has no trend or seasonal component. Since the time series
dataset contains both trend and seasonal components, the model does not capture the components
thus resulting in the flat result. Therefore, the model is not suitable for future sales forecasting
since we have to account for both trend and seasonality.

Figure 14 and Figure 15 show the forecasting result for Holt’s Model for monthly and quarterly
sales. Similarly to the simple exponential smoothing model, the model only accounts for the trend
component but not the seasonality component of the time series dataset. This is because Holt’s
Model allows the forecasting time series dataset with trend components. The forecast function can
be obtained by running a linear regression as a function of the trend and level. Since the model
only captures trend components, the long-term forecasts can be inaccurate as it does not account
for seasonality. However, the model can be used for short term forecasts where the seasonality
component is absent. Therefore, the model is not suitable for forecasting the long-term sales for
the company.

The last forecasting method used in this project is Winter’s Model or popularly known as Holt’s
Winter’s Multiplicative Model. The figure above shows the graph of the monthly and quarterly
sales forecast using the said model. From the graph, it can be seen that the model managed to
capture both trend and seasonality present in the time series dataset. This is beneficial in predicting
the future sales as the business exhibits seasonality and trend in their sales. In the Winter’s
Multiplicative Model, the parameters alpha, beta and gamma are present, representing the
smoothing factor. Alpha represents the level smoothing factor, beta represents the trend smoothing
factor and gamma represents the seasonality smoothing factor. The parameters are being updated
to the past values to make predictions for the future time periods. Using this method, the smoothing
process removes noise and emphasizes the trend and seasonality of the data, making it easier to
make forecasts and obtain valuable insights. Figure 18 and Figure 19 shows the summary of the
fitted model obtained, and it can be seen that the smoothing parameters are being constantly
optimized to produce the best forecasting. Hence, this model is the most suitable method to forecast
the future sales for the company.

Based on Table 2, the forecasting errors of the models are being calculated and the RMSE and
MAPE values are being recorded. RMSE, referring to Root Mean Squared Error, is the square root
of mean squared error between the predicted and actual values. RMSE is better when the value is
lower as higher RMSE value means there is a large deviation in the forecast. On the other hand,
Mean Absolute Percentage Error (MAPE) is the mean of all absolute percentages between the
predicted and actual values. Lower MAPE value indicates that the model performance is better
hence more accurate forecasting.
From the table, it can be seen that Winter’s Multiplication model has the lowest RMSE and MAPE
value, showing the least error in both monthly and quarterly sales forecasting compared to the
other models. This is aligned with the time series data as both trend and seasonality components
exist, hence the model provides the best forecast. Therefore, in forecasting the future sales for
Company ABC, Winter’s Multiplication Model is being selected.

Product Monthly Sales Forecasting by Product Categories

The adaptive forecasting model selected for the sales forecasting for Company ABC products is
Winter’s Multiplication Model. By applying the same methodology explained in the Analytics
Method section, the monthly sales forecasting for three product categories, Furniture, Office
Supplies and Technology is being done and a graph of the forecasting result is being plotted as
shown in figure below. The forecasting error for the three product categories also is being
calculated and as shown in Table 3.

Although in the previous section it was shown that the quarterly average forecasting gives the best
forecasting result, this section focuses on the monthly average forecasting. This is because the
monthly average forecasting gives a better insight on the sales planning for the three product
categories. By breaking down the product categories into three different categories, it can be seen
that the furniture category has the largest seasonality while the sales in office supplies and
technology category shows an upward trend. Monthly forecasting results in a more detailed

prediction to capture the short-term insights. It enables a better understanding of the seasonal
effects, such as the monthly trends and holiday seasons and the company can adjust their sales
strategy and production levels accordingly. Monthly forecasting also allows the company to have
a better insight in allocating resources more efficiently, such as allocating more production,
inventory and workforce levels on busier months. For example, the sales are expected to spike
during the holiday season, so more workforce, production and inventory should be prepared to
accommodate the higher demand.

Another insight obtained is that when breaking down the product categories, the error becomes
larger. This can be due to limited data availability that results in higher variability and larger
forecasting error. In order to mitigate these limitations, the company can improve their data quality
by incorporating more external factors, such as the market trend to improve the forecasting
accuracy. The company can also improve their forecasting error by regularly updating and
adjusting the forecasting model as soon as the new data becomes available. Alternatively, the
company can employ different forecasting techniques such as Seasonal ARIMA model (SARIMA)
or machine learning algorithms to improve the forecasting technique and reduce the errors.

Lastly, based on the forecasting result, there are still some limitations to the Winter’s
Multiplication model. Since the model utilizes the trend and seasonality from historical data, the
model might assume the future pattern will remain the same as the historical data. This assumption
can be false if there are significant changes or external factors that affect the dataset, thus resulting
in more forecasting error. Next, the model is sensitive to initialization where the choice of initial
values for level, trend and seasonal component can affect the forecasting performance. Finally,
Winter’s Multiplication model does not capture any outlier or irregular patterns that may deviate
the results, hence leading to less accurate forecasting. As a result, the company may still need to
employ more forecasting models when they want to do long-term forecasting.

## CONCLUSION

In this project, we have analyzed the time-series Superstore retail dataset using demand planning
analytic. We employed both static forecasting methods and adaptive forecasting methods,
including models such as Simple Moving Average model, Simple Exponential Smoothing model,
Holt’s Model and Winter’s Model to predict the store’s future sales.

After cleaning the data and aggregating it into monthly average sales, we focused on three
categories: Office Supplies, Furniture, and Technology. Our analysis revealed the presence of
seasonality and trend in these categories. However, the static method approached with OLS
regression demonstrates limitation in accurately predicting average sales. The models show weak
fits, low R-squared values, and non-significant coefficients for deseasonalized data. This indicates
that additional variables or factors may be necessary to improve the accuracy of sales predictions
in these categories. On the other hand, in the Adaptive forecasting model, it was found that
Winter’s Model produces the least forecasting error due to the ability of the model to capture the
trend and seasonality component in the dataset. The monthly sales forecasting for the next 6
months using Winter’s Model was also done on product categories such as furniture, office
supplies and technology supplies and it was observed that by breaking down the forecasting into
smaller categories, there is some limitation to the model that leads to larger forecasting error.

Based on our findings, there are several adjustments that can be made to improve the forecasting
and reduce forecasting error. First, the company should improve the data quality by accounting for
external factors, and capturing any outlier or anomalies occurring in the dataset that might lead to
larger forecasting error. Next, the company needs to regularly update their forecasting model to
keep updating the new data to be trained into the forecasting model and lastly, the company can
employ machine learning algorithms or other sophisticated forecasting techniques such as
SARIMA model to improve the forecasting accuracy. By addressing these areas, the company can
improve their forecasting accuracy, improve resource allocation and have an enhanced operational
efficiency.

As a conclusion, this report emphasizes on having efficient demand planning by conducting
demand analytics with appropriate methods. It is crucial for businesses to acknowledge the
importance of continuously improving their demand planning and forecasting strategies. By
leveraging the data-driven insights, incorporating sophisticated techniques, the forecasting error
and limitation could be mitigated, leading to improved customer satisfaction, an efficient resource
allocation and the company can make informed decisions in achieving their business goals.
